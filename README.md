# how to contribute

* clone this repo with: 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lampda/tddc
    ```
* create your own branch `new_branch_name` (each branch corresponds to an independent project) locally with

    ```
    git checkout -b new_branch_name
    ```
* create your *project folder*, such as `my_proj_name`
* add your documents, codes, images, etc, **BUT** NO large files for convenience (providing links for them is recommended if any)
* make your changes to your project files
* commit to a **separate** branch with

    ```
    git commit -m 'any message commenting on this change'
    ```
* push to your project branch with

    ```
    git push origin new_branch_name
    ```
* you are done, waiting for other comments or pull-requests, and then communicating, improving, learning iteratively


# note before push
pull _*request*_ from **ANY** branch, but **NEVER** _*push*_ to **MASTER** branch.
